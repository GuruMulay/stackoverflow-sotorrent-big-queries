#standardSQL
select * from trunc1.Users where id = 13302;

Users and  PostVersionBlock_IJ_PostHistory_UserIdFreq (sorted by edit contribution)


#standardSQL
SELECT U.*

INNER JOIN trunc0.PostVersionBlock_IJ_PostHistory_UserIdFreq
ON PostVersionBlock_IJ_PostHistory_UserIdFreq.UserId = U.Id;



#standardSQL
SELECT Users.*
FROM `trunc1.PostVersionBlock_IJ_PostHistory_UserIdFreq` AS F
INNER JOIN trunc1.Users
ON F.UserId = Users.Id;



correct one =>


#standardSQL
SELECT F.f0_ as EditFreq, Users.*
FROM `trunc1.PostVersionBlock_IJ_PostHistory_UserIdFreq` AS F
INNER JOIN trunc1.Users
ON F.UserId = Users.Id
order by 1 DESC;


output = Users_TopEdits


Club locations together
#standardSQL
select Location, count(*) from trunc1.Users_TopEdits group by Location order by 2 DESC;
The query above is gives incorrect answers because even 1 edit freq user will get thier location, so limit EditFreq to at least 1000

So =>

#standardSQL
select Location, count(*) from trunc1.Users_TopEdits where EditFreq >= 1000 group by Location order by 2 DESC
